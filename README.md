# üó∫Ô∏è Acibadem Information Offices Map

This project is a web application that displays Acibadem's worldwide information offices on an interactive map. It is enhanced with modern UI features and an optional AI assistant to provide a rich user experience for patients and their relatives planning to travel to Turkey for medical services.

- **Zoom-Based Labels:** Office names automatically appear as clean, readable labels when the user zooms in, improving clarity without cluttering the map.

- **Layer Control:** Allows switching between a "Street Map" and a "Satellite View".
